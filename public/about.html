  up now so come and join me as we learn the many techniques of web development.

<p>A little bit about me. I am a 33 year old Georgia Southern graduate with a bachlors in computer science. I went to school for
  a long time you could say it took me a bit longer to understand some of the things it took to graduate from a university.
  One of the things I learned was patience and never giving up even when things may look the darkest there is always a light.

<p>Some of my hobbies and intrest are basketball, and gaming. I having been watching basketball for a long time now.
  My favortie team is the Miami Heat, and I hope to one day be able to see a game in Miami. My favortie player is Lebron James,
  and I think that he is the goat of basketball for me this a heavily debated topic. I also enjoy sitting back and playing some video
  games. I think it was one of the main reasons that I got into computer science as a carrer. My favorite type of games are RPGs. 
  I like to immersive myself into a game and RPGs do a great job at creating those moments. That a bit about me and stay tunned, as I am
  sure there will be more to tell of my story as time goes on.
